## Collaboration Guidelines

### Version Control System Best Practices
- Use Git as the VCS to track all changes.
- Always commit small, logical changes to ensure clarity.
- Review commit history frequently to maintain clean logs.

### Branching Strategy
- Create a new branch for each task or feature (e.g., `feature/add-login`).
- Merge branches into the `main` branch only after thorough testing and review.

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Good example: `Add user authentication feature.`
- Bad example: `Fixed stuff.`
